# PythonGraphingPlayground
I am taking a statistics course in school, so I wanted to be able to do some simple graphing programmatically.

The code in here will be using the python library known as matplotlib.

Most of the code uses pyplot, which I believe is an abstraction to matplotlib which allows me to
make graphs very quickly.
